# ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Forecasting Scripts

This directory contains test and demo scripts for the multi-agent forecasting system.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## ðŸš€ Available Scripts

### `npm run demo:simple`
**Quick demo with a single prediction market forecast**

- Tests the complete pipeline with auto-generated drivers
- Works with Polymarket or Kalshi markets
- Shows forecast results and top evidence
- Perfect for first-time testing

**Example output:**
```
ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Forecasting Demo
ðŸ“Š Question: Will AI achieve AGI by 2030?
ðŸ“ˆ Forecast Probability: 23.4%
ðŸŽ¯ Key Drivers: Research breakthroughs, Compute scaling, Regulatory framework
```

### `npm run test:forecast`
**Comprehensive test suite**

- Tests multiple market types (AI, politics, crypto, sports)
- Tests both Polymarket and Kalshi platforms
- Includes system health checks
- Shows performance metrics and error handling

### `npm run test:kalshi`
**Kalshi integration test**

- Tests Kalshi API connectivity
- Validates URL parsing for both platforms
- Tests event-level and market-level fetching

**Test categories:**
- System Health Check
- Polymarket Integration Tests
- General Forecasting Tests
- Error Handling Validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Customizing Tests

### Change the Market in Simple Demo

Edit `scripts/demo-simple.ts` to use either platform:

**Polymarket:**
```typescript
const result = await runUnifiedForecastPipeline({
  marketUrl: 'https://polymarket.com/event/your-market-slug',
});
```

**Kalshi:**
```typescript
const result = await runUnifiedForecastPipeline({
  marketUrl: 'https://kalshi.com/markets/kxfeddecision/fed-meeting/KXFEDDEC-25DEC18',
});
```

### Popular Markets to Try (2025)

**Polymarket:**
- `https://polymarket.com/event/will-ai-achieve-agi-by-2030` - AI/Technology
- `https://polymarket.com/event/bitcoin-200k-by-2030` - Cryptocurrency
- `https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-win-2024` - Politics

**Kalshi:**
- `https://kalshi.com/markets/kxfeddecision/fed-meeting` - Fed Rate Decisions
- `https://kalshi.com/markets/kxratecutcount/number-of-rate-cuts` - Economic Policy
- `https://kalshi.com/markets/kxmlb/world-series` - Sports

### Add Custom Drivers

```typescript
const result = await runUnifiedForecastPipeline({
  marketUrl: 'https://polymarket.com/event/your-market',
  drivers: ['Custom factor 1', 'Custom factor 2'], // Override auto-generation
  historyInterval: '4h', // Override auto-optimization
});
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OPENAI_API_KEY not found"**
- Make sure `.env` file exists with valid API key
- Ensure your key has GPT-5 access

**"Network error"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Valyu search service is accessible

**"Market not found"**
- Use a valid, active market URL
- For Polymarket: Check the market exists on polymarket.com
- For Kalshi: Check the market is still active on kalshi.com
- Kalshi markets may close quickly (especially sports)

**TypeScript errors**
- Run `npm run build` to check for compilation issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Debug Mode

Add more logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=1 npm run demo:simple
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding Results

### Forecast Probability
- **p_neutral**: Evidence-based probability (ignoring market)
- **p_aware**: Market-blended probability (small Î± blend)

### Evidence Influence
- **deltaPP**: How much each piece of evidence moved the forecast
- **logLR**: Log-likelihood ratio of the evidence

### Drivers
- **Auto-generated**: System analyzes market and creates relevant factors
- **Custom**: User-provided key factors to focus analysis on

### Evidence Types
- **Type A (2.0 cap)**: Primary data, official documents
- **Type B (1.6 cap)**: Secondary sources, expert analysis
- **Type C (0.8 cap)**: Tertiary sources citing primary/secondary
- **Type D (0.3 cap)**: Weak sources, speculation

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Start with simple demo**: `npm run demo:simple`
2. **Run full test suite**: `npm run test:forecast`
3. **Try different markets**: Edit the slug in demo-simple.ts
4. **Build your own integration**: Use the API at `/api/forecast`
