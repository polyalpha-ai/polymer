# Multi-Agent Forecasting System: Complete Analysis Report

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

The Polyseer multi-agent forecasting system uses 6 specialized GPT-5 agents to analyze Polymarket prediction markets and generate evidence-based probability forecasts. The system employs Bayesian aggregation with log-likelihood ratios, clustering, and market blending to produce two key outputs: a neutral probability (`pNeutral`) and a market-aware probability (`pAware`).

**Key Finding**: The Critic Agent currently has **NO MATHEMATICAL INFLUENCE** on the final forecast - it only generates metadata for human review.

## üîÑ **System Architecture & Process Flow**

### **Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Setup**
```
1. Fetch Polymarket Data ‚Üí 2. Auto-Generate Parameters ‚Üí 3. Calculate Prior (p0)
```

**1.1 Market Data Fetching**
- Fetches market facts, current prices, and historical data from Polymarket
- Auto-optimizes history interval based on market characteristics
- Extracts the market question for analysis

**1.2 Parameter Auto-Generation**
- **Drivers**: GPT-5 analyzes the market question to generate 3-8 key factors that could influence the outcome
- **History Interval**: System selects optimal granularity ('1h', '4h', '1d', '1w') based on market volume and time to close

**1.3 Prior Calculation (p0)**
```typescript
// Prior is derived from current market price, clamped to avoid extreme values
p0 = Math.max(0.1, Math.min(0.9, currentMarketPrice));
```

### **Phase 2: Multi-Agent Research Pipeline**
```
Planner ‚Üí Pro-Researcher & Con-Researcher ‚Üí Critic ‚Üí Analyst ‚Üí Reporter
```

**2.1 Planner Agent**
- Breaks down the market question into:
  - **Subclaims**: 2-10 testable claims that would resolve the question
  - **Key Variables**: 2-15 measurable factors influencing the outcome
  - **Search Seeds**: 3-20 specific search queries
  - **Decision Criteria**: 3-8 clear resolution criteria

**2.2 Researcher Agents (Parallel Execution)**
- **Pro-Researcher**: Searches for evidence supporting the outcome
- **Con-Researcher**: Searches for evidence contradicting the outcome
- Both use Valyu web search tools to find real-time information
- Each generates 2-5 structured evidence items with quality scores

**2.3 Critic Agent** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NO MATHEMATICAL IMPACT**
```typescript
// Current implementation - generates metadata only
const critique = await criticAgent(question, pro, con);
console.log(`üß™ Critic pass completed.`); // Just logging, no data used
```
- Identifies missing evidence, duplicates, and bias risks
- **Critical Issue**: The critique output is completely ignored in calculations
- Only serves as metadata for human review

**2.4 Analyst Agent**
- Performs Bayesian aggregation of all evidence
- Calculates neutral probability and market-aware probability
- Generates influence scores for each piece of evidence

**2.5 Reporter Agent**
- Creates human-readable Markdown forecast report
- Incorporates drivers, evidence influence, and caveats

## üßÆ **Mathematical Framework**

### **Evidence Scoring System**

Each piece of evidence gets a **Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR)** score:

```typescript
evidenceLogLR = polarity √ó typeCap √ó (0.5√óverifiability + 0.3√ócorroborations + 0.2√óconsistency)

// If first report: multiply by 0.5 penalty
// Clamp result to [-typeCap, +typeCap]
```

**Evidence Type Caps:**
- **Type A** (Primary data): ¬±2.0 max impact
- **Type B** (Secondary analysis): ¬±1.6 max impact  
- **Type C** (Tertiary sources): ¬±0.8 max impact
- **Type D** (Weak sources): ¬±0.3 max impact

**Quality Factors:**
- **Verifiability** (0-1): How recomputable/checkable the claim is
- **Corroborations** (0+): Number of independent confirmations ‚Üí `r = 1 - exp(-k)`
- **Consistency** (0-1): Internal logical coherence
- **First Report Penalty**: 0.5√ó multiplier for unconfirmed breaking news

### **Bayesian Aggregation Process**

**Step 1: Clustering by Origin**
```typescript
// Group evidence by originId to handle correlation
clusters = clusterByOrigin(evidence);
```

**Step 2: Effective Count Calculation**
```typescript
// Adjust for correlation within clusters
effectiveCount = m / (1 + (m-1) √ó œÅ)
// where m = cluster size, œÅ = correlation (default 0.6 for m>1, 0.0 for m=1)
```

**Step 3: Log-Odds Aggregation**
```typescript
logOdds = logit(p0); // Start with prior

for each cluster:
  meanLLR = trimmedMean(clusterLLRs, trimFraction=0.2); // Remove outliers
  contribution = effectiveCount √ó meanLLR;
  logOdds += contribution;

pNeutral = sigmoid(logOdds); // Convert back to probability
```

**Step 4: Market Blending (Optional)**
```typescript
// Small alpha blend with current market price
pAware = sigmoid(logit(pNeutral) + 0.1 √ó logit(marketPrice))
```

### **Influence Calculation**

For each evidence item, calculate its impact on the final probability:

```typescript
// Remove this evidence from its cluster and recalculate
pWithout = recalculateWithoutEvidence(evidence_i);
influence = |pNeutral - pWithout|; // Absolute change in probability
```

---

## üéØ **Final Verdict Decision Process**

### **Primary Output: pNeutral**
The system's **main forecast** based purely on evidence aggregation:

1. **Start** with market-derived prior (p0)
2. **Add** log-likelihood contributions from each evidence cluster
3. **Apply** correlation adjustments and outlier trimming
4. **Convert** final log-odds back to probability

### **Secondary Output: pAware** 
A **market-informed** forecast that slightly adjusts toward current market pricing:

```
pAware = blend(pNeutral, marketPrice, Œ±=0.1)
```

This creates a "firewall" - the system first calculates its independent view, then optionally incorporates market wisdom.

### **Decision Factors Ranking**
1. **Evidence Quality** (Type A > B > C > D)
2. **Evidence Quantity** (More independent sources)
3. **Verifiability** (Recomputable claims weighted higher)
4. **Correlation Adjustment** (Reduces impact of duplicate sources)
5. **Market Signal** (Small influence via Œ±=0.1 blending)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical System Issues**

### **1. Critic Agent Has Zero Impact**
```typescript
// Line 95 in orchestrator.ts - critique is generated but never used
await criticAgent(question, pro, con);
console.log(`üß™ Critic pass completed.`);

// The critique output is completely ignored in subsequent calculations
```

**Impact**: The system loses valuable quality control that could:
- Flag duplicate evidence for higher correlation adjustments
- Identify missing evidence types for more balanced analysis  
- Detect bias patterns that should adjust confidence intervals

### **2. Potential Improvements**
- **Use critic output** to adjust `rhoByCluster` correlations
- **Flag evidence** for exclusion based on duplication concerns
- **Adjust confidence intervals** based on identified missing evidence
- **Weight evidence differently** based on bias risk assessment

---

## üìä **Performance Characteristics**

### **Strengths**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time web search** integration with Valyu tools
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically rigorous** Bayesian aggregation
- ‚úÖ **Correlation handling** via clustering and effective counts
- ‚úÖ **Quality weighting** via evidence type caps and scoring
- ‚úÖ **Outlier resistance** via trimmed mean calculations
- ‚úÖ **Market firewall** prevents circular reasoning

### **Weaknesses**
- ‚ùå **Critic agent unused** - missing quality control feedback loop
- ‚ùå **Fixed correlation assumptions** (œÅ=0.6) rather than dynamic estimation
- ‚ùå **No confidence intervals** - point estimates only
- ‚ùå **Limited evidence diversity** - depends on search tool coverage

---

## üîß **Recommended Enhancements**

### **1. Integrate Critic Feedback**
```typescript
// Use critic output to improve aggregation
const critique = await criticAgent(question, pro, con);

// Adjust correlations based on duplication flags
const adjustedRho = adjustCorrelations(rhoByCluster, critique.duplicationFlags);

// Filter or downweight flagged evidence
const filteredEvidence = filterEvidence(evidence, critique.dataConcerns);
```

### **2. Dynamic Correlation Estimation**
- Analyze evidence content similarity for better œÅ estimates
- Use URL domain clustering for news source correlation
- Implement time-based correlation for breaking news

### **3. Confidence Intervals**
- Bootstrap resampling of evidence subsets
- Uncertainty propagation through the aggregation chain
- Missing evidence impact modeling

## üìà **Example Calculation Walkthrough**

**Market**: "Lisa Cook out as Fed Governor by September 30?"
**Prior (p0)**: 0.125 (from current market price)

**Evidence Found**:
- 3 Pro evidence items (supporting departure)
- 4 Con evidence items (supporting staying)

**Aggregation**:
1. **Prior log-odds**: logit(0.125) = -1.946
2. **Evidence contributions**: Sum of cluster-adjusted LLRs
3. **Final log-odds**: -1.946 + evidence_contributions = 0.318
4. **Final probability**: sigmoid(0.318) = 0.579 (57.9%)

**Market Blend**:
- pAware = blend(0.579, 0.125, 0.1) = 0.531 (53.1%)

**Result**: System forecasts 57.9% chance (vs 12.5% market price), with market-aware adjustment to 53.1%.

## üéØ **Conclusion**

The multi-agent system implements a sophisticated Bayesian forecasting framework with real-time evidence gathering. However, the **Critic Agent currently provides zero mathematical influence** on the final forecast, representing a significant missed opportunity for quality control and bias detection.

The system's strength lies in its rigorous mathematical foundation and real-time data integration, but it would benefit significantly from incorporating the critic's insights into the aggregation process.
